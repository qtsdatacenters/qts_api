# QTS API

QTS, a leading provider of software-defined and mega scale data center solutions, has published its RESTful application programming interface (API) definitions as Open Source on Github under the BSD license to provide maximum transparency and offer as a basis of an open standard for the industry. 

QTS is committed to the digitization of its end-to-end systems and processes to enable new ways for its customers and employees to interact with QTSâ€™ platform and accelerate the deployment of new services and solutions. 

The JSON for RESTful APIs can be accessed in the Postman Collection file:
https://github.com/qtsdatacenters/qts_api/tree/master/Postman%20Collections

These APIs support real-time access to all aspects of data center operations including security, power, cooling, sensors, provisioning and many other key metrics. This allows developers to embed the API into their own systems allowing increased control and visibility of their data center footprint.

Detailed documentation of each API can be found at https://docs.qtsdatacenters.com
